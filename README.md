# Spanning-Tree-Generator

A spanning tree generator is a tool used to create a spanning tree for a given graph. A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while forming a tree structure with no cycles. The generator typically works by employing Prim's algorithm.
